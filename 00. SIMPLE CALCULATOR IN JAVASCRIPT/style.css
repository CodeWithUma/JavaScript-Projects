  Certainly! This is a block of CSS code that styles the calculator container on the web page. Here's what each line does:
  
  1. .calculator is a CSS class selector that targets the div element with class="calculator" in the HTML code.
  
  2. width: 300px; sets the width of the calculator container to 300 pixels.
  
  3. margin: 20px auto; sets a margin of 20 pixels on the top and bottom, and centers the container horizontally using auto for the left and right margins.
  
  4. padding: 10px; adds 10 pixels of padding to the inside of the container, which gives some space between the border and the contents.
  
  5. border: 1px solid #ccc; adds a 1-pixel solid border around the container, with a color of #ccc (light gray).
  
  6. border-radius: 5px; sets the border radius of the container to 5 pixels, which rounds the corners of the border.
  
  7. text-align: center; centers the contents of the container horizontally, which centers the input field and buttons.

  2. margin: 5px 0; sets a margin of 5 pixels on the top and bottom of the button row, and 0 pixels on the left and right. This creates

  4. 'font-size: 20px;' sets the font size of the text inside the buttons to 20 pixels.
  
  5. 'border: 1px solid #ccc;' adds a 1-pixel solid border around the buttons with a color of #ccc (a light gray).

  8. 'background-color: #f2f2f2;' sets the background color of the buttons to #f2f2f2 (a light gray), which provides a subtle contrast to 
      the white background of the calculator container.
